## ChatGPT Comparison (As of may 2023)

If you ask ChatGpt about the casualties of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict you will always get the same answer. 
ChatGPT is only trained until September 2021 so it cannot give accurate information. Furthermore does it only give the
rough estimate "thousands have died", since that is an undisputed truth. It further gives you the recommendation to 
search for your own trusted sources and research yourself. It also gives some examples of sources.  
My Chatbot gives direct data but does not make sure, that Wikipedia or Statista actually have the right sources and
therefor numbers. This might result in misinformation being spread.
